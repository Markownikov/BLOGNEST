# BLOGNEST


## Blog Application Assignment (Frontend + Backend)


Developed a comprehensive blog application using React.js for the frontend with
Material-UI (MUI) for styling, Redux for state management, and a rich text editor to create and
edit blog posts. The application should also include a theme switcher for toggling between light
and dark modes. Additionally, implemented a backend to manage CRUD operations for blog
content, user authentication, users can share blogs with others, specifying permission levels
(view/edit) for shared access.

## Frontend Deliverables:

## Core Features:
- **Blog Management**: Implemented CRUD operations to allow users to create, read,
update, and delete blog posts.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Integrated a rich text editor for blog creation and editing.
- **Theme Switcher**: Implemented a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark
modes.
- **Responsive UI**: Ensure the UI is responsive and works seamlessly across
different screen sizes.
## Pages and Navigation:
- **HomePage**: Display a list of featured blogs with their titles, excerpts, and
publication dates. Included a sidebar or navbar with categories (e.g., Technology,
Travel, Food, Lifestyle).
- **Category Pages**: Created separate pages for each category, displaying blogs
specific to that category.
- **Filtering and Search**: Implemented filtering by category and a search option for
users to find specific blogs.
- **Blog Details Page**: Clicking on a blog title or excerpt should navigate the user to
a detailed view of that blog, displaying the full content, image, author, publication
date, and metadata.
## State Management:
- Used Redux for centralized state management, ensuring efficient actions and
reducers.
Backend Deliverables:
1. Technology Stack:
- Selectd  backend technology stack (e.g., Node.js with Express) for implementing CRUD operations and data storage.
2. Database Setup:
- Set up database (MongoDB) to store blog content,
images, user information, and permissions.
- Define schemas to manage blog posts, users, and permissions.
3. User Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement user authentication and authorization to secure API endpoints.
- Use JWT or session-based authentication to ensure CRUD operations are
restricted to authenticated users.
4. Blog Sharing and Permissions:
- Enable users to share their blogs with others by specifying another user's ID.
- Implement access control to define permissions (view or edit) for shared blogs.
5. CRUD Operations:
- Implement CRUD operations for managing blog posts (Create, Read, Update,
Delete).
6. Error Handling:
- Implement error handling for API requests and responses.
- Provide meaningful error messages to users in case of failures.
7. User Dashboard:
- After login, users should be able to see their personal blogs.
- Users can create, edit, and delete their blogs.
- Users can share their blogs with others and define access levels (view or edit).
